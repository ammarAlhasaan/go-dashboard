#### Notes: 
- Most of the components built from scratch to keep the project smother.
- I didn't add routes library because we have only one page now.
- In the components folder we have a small design system.
- There was an issue with the icons in Figma, and I was not able to convert the icon to font icon using icomoon tool that's why I exported them as svg file.
- The design in figma has been built with large screen, so I tried to change a bit with the spacing to have a responsive design.
- I've added setTimeout for loading the data to show card loader.
